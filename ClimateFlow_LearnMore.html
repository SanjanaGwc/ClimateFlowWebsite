As global citizens, we have a duty to upkeep the integrity and purity of our planet. Not only for the quality of our lives but for our
future generations. Our website, CLIMATE FLOW, is intended to serve as an educational platform that visualizes the alarming trend of
deteriorating ecosystems and rather rampant accumulation of toxic chemicals that threatens every living organism on this planet.
Our website also serves as a stepping stone for every citizen to begin their journey to cleaner planet.

In todays’ world we are surrounded by copious amounts of data without any simple yet precise visualization of the data’s impact.
Our website is designed with this vision of creating a comprehensive representation of the deteriorating resources on Earth.
Our atmosphere simulation depicts the global emissions of the leading 5 countries from 2010 to 2050. Our ocean simulation allows
users to explore the damage coral reefs have endured from December 2014 to February 2015 through an interactive slider.
